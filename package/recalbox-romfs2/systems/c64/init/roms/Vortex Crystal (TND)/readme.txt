2017 FULL VERSION

LOADING THE GAME FROM DISK:

Type in LOAD”*”,8 and then enter RUN. Use Spacebar to skip the TND intro screen, like usual.

An options screen will then appear on screen asking whether you would like to use the IRQ Fastloader, or not. If you select 'Y' to use the IRQ fastloader. The program will load with music playing. Selecting 'N' uses KERNAL load, unless you already have installed a software fastloader in place (IE Action Replay MKVI, Retro Replay, etc).

SDIEC users, select 'N' to disable fastload, since that isn't compatible with SDIEC.

LOADING THE GAME FROM TAPE:

Press SHIFT+RUN/STOP, press PLAY on tape, and wait for the game to load and run. The game uses the Freeload tape master system and will take a few minutes to load and run.

GAME SCENARIO:

It is the future. Scientists have discovered a form of energy crystals on the planet Vektor. These crystals might be able to protect the world from alien invasion. The Vektor crystals have been gathered and transported safely to Earth.

But one of the scientists on board the transport ship was unexpectedly bitten by an alien – and he himself then mutated into a humanoid alien.

On Earth, a huge complex of 16 floors was built to store the crystals. They were protected by security forces. Later, an alien mothership appeared above this Vortex Complex and a slimy green alien took over the security system. Aliens then beamed into each chamber to guard the crystals... So that an invasion can take place.

The Prime Minister, Ed Master, has called for your help. You don a protective black suit, and arm yourself with a powerful laser. You grab a swipe card and enter the building. You realise that the building is not how it was before – considering that it is now infested with aliens. Trigger happy, you are happy for action and have an appetite of destruction at last!

PLAYING THE GAME:

This is a single-screen platform game for one player only. The object is to guide your Special Forces operative safely through each room of the Vortex Complex. Pick up all the crystals before you make a break for the exit. Unfortunately, the mission will not be easy... especially when you have a limited amount of ammo.

The first task is pick up all of the crystals and crush them. Alien droids will be guarding each level. Blast them, and pick up the ammo charger card which gives you 10 extra shots. As soon as all of the crystals have been picked up, you must blast an alien in order to get an exit card.

If you miss the exit card, you still have a chance. Just shoot another alien! Cards will appear on the ground or in mid-air. They will also disappear after a short period of time, so be quick to get them!

If you pick up the exit card, an exit will appear either by the door or a secret gate. Try and make your way to the exit carefully. As soon as you reach the exit, the level is completed. You will then be awarded bonus points for the remaining amount of ammo. Try to avoid running out of bullets too quickly, or you will be trapped. If you do, death is imminent.

WARNING: You have a set time before the security lock-down will trap you forever. This will activate a gas substance, which can kill human beings instantly. The time inside the complex cannot be extended.


OBSTACLES:

ALIEN DROIDS – These will move back and forth, or up and down, at two different set speeds. Depending on the alien form, they are as follows:

Cycloid – An airborne spinning alien - 3 hits to destroy
Walker – A grounded alien with bionic legs – 3 hits to destroy
Zorbot – A grounded robot with a spinning satellite – 5 hits to destroy
I-Droid – An airborne eyeball – 5 hits to destroy
Squidroid – A killer-squid robot – 8 hits to destroy
Robot – The name says it all. Ground-based, deadly and fast – 10 hits to destroy

After destroying each alien, if there is no ammo card (marked 'A') available, a new one will appear.

PLATFORMS AND LADDERS

You can jump across platforms and ladders, and fall from any height. Try not to fall through the deadly holes at the bottom, or you will be vaporised.

Ladders can help you climb up to other platforms which are too high for jumping.

CONVEYORS

While you are walking on conveyor belts, they will push and pull you, depending on the direction the belts are moving. Aliens have more move power on the belts, unlike you. Be very careful!

HIGH VOLTAGE SPIKES

These may look small and harmless, but are powered with thousands of volts of electricity. One touch and you are instantly fried!

HOLES

The holes at the bottom of the screen are deadly and should be avoided.

Can you clear all 16 rooms of the Vortex crystals and save the world from alien invasion? Or will you be trapped in the complex forever – dead? No matter what happens, the world depends on you.

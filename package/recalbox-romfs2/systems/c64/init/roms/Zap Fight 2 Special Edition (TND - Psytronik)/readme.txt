5 Stars = Multi-firing Triple Laser
6 Stars = Drone (Invincible Drone)

EXTRA LIVES

There are two ways of gaining extra lives. The first method is by collecting 10 stars from the default phase. Be warned, this will prove a challenge since losing a life will make you have to collect 10 stars all over again. 

The other way to gain an extra life is by scoring 10,000 points. You can carry up to 10 lives, and no more. The 10th life is marked as a STAR. This shows how much of a star you are at playing this game :)

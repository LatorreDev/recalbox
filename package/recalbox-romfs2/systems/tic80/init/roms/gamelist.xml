    <desc>Since the ancient times, the humanity knew very well about the exceptional values of the cauliflower plant: nutritional, medicinal, or aesthetic. Some even went as far as to claim it can ward off demonic spirit, boosts the intellectual power, or becomes a decent booze if you know what to do. Yet only in 2027, in a sudden flash of enlightenment, Dr. P.Golabek of CDDA Labs realized the true potential hidden in the unloved part of his meal. There was more to the boiled curd of the brassica oleracea than what it seemed on the surface. The discovery didn't go unnoticed, and instead of bringing prosperity and nutrition, the wondrous plant became outlawed along with significant number of unrelated species of brassicaceae family. The time has come to put an end to it and let the cauliflower bloom everywhere! Welcome to the Cauliflower Research Liberation Front, comrade!</desc>

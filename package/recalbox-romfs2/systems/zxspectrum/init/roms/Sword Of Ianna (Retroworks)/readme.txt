This ZIP file contains three DSK files:

- ianna-3dos.dsk: this is a 720KB DSK image. You can use it if your emulator
  supports a double-sided, 80 track disk. Most do by default, but for example
  in FUSE you have to set it up in Options -> Disk options.

- ianna-sidea.dsk / ianna-sideb.dsk: these are 180 KB DSK images, which you
  can transfer to a 3-inch disk and play with an unmodified Spectrum +3.
  Side A will load the loading screen and main code, and then it will ask you
  to switch to side B.

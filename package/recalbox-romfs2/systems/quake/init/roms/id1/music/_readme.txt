Soundtrack files
TyrQuake supports playback of the original soundtrack from the base game and official mission packs' CDs.

CD audio should be ripped into OGG format files, and placed into a subfolder named music of the appropriate folder (id1, hipnotic or rogue). The ripped CD tracks must be named trackXX.ogg, corresponding to the original CD track index for each audio track. Considering that the first CD track in all cases is the data track, the first audio track will always begin with track 02, which should be reflected in the filename of the ripped audio files.

As stated on Steve's site and on AtariAge:

Developer's Proceeds to Charity
"All of the developer's proceeds for Cave In will be donated to Autism Speaks. Autism is one of the fastest growing developmental disabilities in the US, with 1 in 91 children being diagnosed (as of October 2009). It knows no cultural or racial boundaries, and that number is increasing every year. My son was diagnosed with Autism at the age of two, 9 years ago. So much has been discovered and learned since then, but there is still no cure. By purchasing Cave In you're not just getting a great game for the Atari 2600, you're also contributing to a great cause that needs everyone's attention, and you're helping to fund research that will hopefully find a cure. Thank you for your support and your interest in Cave In, and for helping my wife and I support Autism Speaks."

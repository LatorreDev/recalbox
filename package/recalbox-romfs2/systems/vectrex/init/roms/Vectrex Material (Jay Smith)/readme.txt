VECTREX
=======

The Vectrex Console was originally designed by Smith Engenerring, and manufactuted by General Consumer Electronics, and later by Milton Bradley Compagny.

After the Vectrex's discontinuation, the rights reverted to Smith Engineering. Then, in the mid-1990s, Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering,
allowed new hardware and software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis.
Smith has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis to allow Vectrex owners to obtain the original titles at low cost or for free.

As stated in the above document:

"Today, Smith Engineering has graciously condoned the not-for-profit distribution of any of the Vectrex's duplicable materials,
including games, overlays and manuals. Because of the system's uniqueness,
it has inspired a loyal group of Vectrex fanatics who have churned out emulators, web pages, and even new games."

We, at Recalbox, always considered this console an unique piece of the video game history.
That is, we decided to include some of the most relevent games as a tribute to this awesome and unique home console!

    <name>Mine Storm</name>
    <desc>The game begins with a large enemy ship dropping mines onto the field as an ominous jingle plays, and moves from the top to the bottom of the screen, where it disappears. The player's ship starts in the middle of the field with 5 lives. Numerous mines then start popping up. The player must destroy all of the mines in order to progress to the next minefield. All of the mines can be destroyed with one shot, or hit with the player's ship, costing the player a life. There are 4 types of mines. 
This game came programmed onto the Vectrex.</desc>

    <desc>Watch out for that next mountain! Maneuver your ship over a rough terrain in an effort to destroy the enemy base. Careful piloting alone won't get you to your destination... You must brave rockets, UFOs, flamoids and some very tight tunnels. Few people have ever seen the enemy base, let alone destroy it. Will you be one of the select few?

    <desc>The player has to penetrate various planets to attach a tow-bar to Kylstron Pods, and get out alive. In doing so you can stop the Intergalactic Empire from achieving its evil plan. The game is difficult enough to make a gamer curse, but fun enough to make one smile too!</desc>

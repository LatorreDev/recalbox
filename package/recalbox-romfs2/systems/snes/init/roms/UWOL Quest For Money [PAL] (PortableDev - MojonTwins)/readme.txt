Run, jump and collect all 255 coins all along the levels!
If your reach the ground of the pyramid without enough coins, you'll have to restart from the top and choose another path to collect more coins.

Hit a monster and your hero will take off its T-Shirt. Hit a monster again makes you die, unless you get the T-Shit bonus!

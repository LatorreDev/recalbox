 Nutmeg is an extended version of Photon Storm's HTML5 game Nutmeg, which is a
 one button side scrolling jump and run game. The first five levels are the
 original ones. Other levels are new and an original creation.
 
 Retroguru kindly thanks Richard Davey (Photon Storm) and Ilija Melentijevic
 for permission to pick up on Nutmeg.

 |_______|

 Help Nutmeg the duck rescue his buddies, who were suddenly kidnapped
 out of nothing.
 
 The kidnapped blue ducks have been scattered in different places. The
 flying vehicle of the bad guy that kidnapped your friends left a track 
 of golden stars. You can collect them to gain points at the end of every
 level, and possibly follow them to suggest the easiest path. Remember
 that not all stars can be kept (at least not safely) and pay attention
 to false hints. Also mind obstacles and enemies, who lead to a certain
 death.

 There are 4 worlds with each 5 levels... but can you find the hidden
 world? Find small clues while playing the first four worlds and make
 sure to really rescue all your friends.
 
 At the end of every level you get a life, extra points for collected
 stars and a bonus for the remaining time. Learn each level by heart and
 keep the timing in mind before you aim for better scores. The way to 
 success is difficult.
 
 If you lose your last life you can choose to continue the game from the
 level you just played, but your score resets to zero. When you lose all
 your lives or if you beat all the levels of a world, if you achieved a
 high score for that world, it will be shown on the high score screen.

 High scores remain saved after shutting down the game only if you play the
 game using a game cart with integrated save EEPROM, an HQ SD cart with save
 game enabled, or an emulator with support for saving EEPROM.

 There are some cheat codes that can help you a little in mastering the game,
 but they don't make it any easier, and wonâ€™t help you too much with getting
 a high score.

 If you find cheats, please keep them for yourself ;-)

 Nutmeg for Atari Lynx can be played on a real Atari Lynx writing an EEPROM Lynx cart
 of at least 256 KB with the nutmeg.lnx file (removing the starting 64 bytes header),
 or using a RetroHD SD cart.

 It can also be played on Lynx emulators, but most emulators will have sound issues. 

 The game saves higscores if a Lynx cart with an extra 128 bytes EEPROM chip is in
 use. Emulators need to support EEPROM emulation.
 
 To enable saves on a RetroHQ SD cart, a file named nutmeg.sav of 128 bytes must be
 created on the SD in the /saves/ folder (the content of the file is not important and 
 will be overwritten at first use).

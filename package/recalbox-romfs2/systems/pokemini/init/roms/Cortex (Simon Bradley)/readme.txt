CHANGES
0.70 - 2006-12-31 - Now saves progress.
0.61 - 2006-07-09 - Added most of the front end (not finished yet). Fix a 
couple of bugs that I found as a result of the easier level access.
0.53 - 2005-08-08 - Fixed scolling interference problem. Added version number
to title screen. Initialised RAM. Fix wall tiles on some later levels. Spread
the map redraw over several frames to reduce load.
0.52 - 2005-08-07 - Changed video register.
0.51 - 2005-07-17 - Fixed bug where occasionally the wrong block would get
deleted.
0.5 - 2005-07-16 - The game is now playable, but still needs quite a lot of
work to make it more friendly.
